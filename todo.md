# Task List - Fullstack Challenge

## 1. Requirements Analysis and Planning
- âœ… Thoroughly review the challenge instructions.
- âœ… Define the overall application architecture (Backend: Laravel; Frontend: VueJS).
- âœ… Identify critical requirements (weather data must be updated every 1 hour and internal API requests must respond within 500ms).

## 2. Setting Up the Development Environment
- âœ… Install Node.js version 18.
- âœ… Configure the Docker environment for the backend (Laravel).
- âœ… Copy the .env.example file to .env.
- âœ… Install PHP dependencies via Composer.
- âœ… Generate the application key using `php artisan key:generate`.
- âœ… Run database migrations with `php artisan migrate`.
- âœ… Execute the seeder to add 20 users with unique locations.

## 3. Building the API with Laravel
- âœ… Initialize the Laravel project.
- [ ] Set up routes and controllers to provide weather data.
- [ ] Ensure internal API requests respond within 500ms.

## 4. Integration with the Weather API
- [ ] Choose a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or Weather.gov). ðŸ’¡
- [ ] Develop the integration with the external weather API.
- [ ] Implement error handling and fallback strategies in case the external API is unavailable.

## 5. Developing the Frontend with VueJS
- âœ… Set up the VueJS environment and install necessary npm dependencies.
- [ ] Build the landing page to list users with their current weather data.
- [ ] Implement functionality to open a modal or new page with detailed weather information when a user is clicked.
- [ ] (Optional) Integrate a UI library (e.g., Vuetify, Tailwind, Bootstrap) to enhance the presentation.

## 6. Testing and Optimization
- [ ] Write automated tests for both the backend and frontend.
- [ ] Implement caching using Redis to optimize API responses.
- [ ] Consider using queues and workers for asynchronous operations.
- [ ] Monitor and optimize the application performance to ensure fast responses.

## 7. Documentation and Delivery
- [ ] Document the development process and the technical decisions made.
- [ ] Send the cloned repository link to the interviewer.
- [ ] Report the total time spent completing the challenge.

## Additional Notes

### Weather API Selection
For this challenge, I will choose the OpenWeatherMap API as the primary weather data provider. OpenWeatherMap offers a free tier with a reasonable number of requests per minute, making it suitable for this project. Additionally, it provides a wide range of weather data, including current weather, forecasts, and historical data. As a secondary provider, I will consider using the AccuWeather API, which offers similar features and data quality.

### Application Architecture
```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ Contracts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WeatherProviderInterface.php         # Define os mÃ©todos que qualquer provedor de clima deve implementar.
â”œâ”€â”€ Jobs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ UpdateWeatherJob.php                   # Job agendado para buscar os dados de clima periodicamente.
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Weather/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ PrimaryWeatherProvider.php         # ImplementaÃ§Ã£o da API primÃ¡ria (ex: OpenWeatherMap).
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ SecondaryWeatherProvider.php       # ImplementaÃ§Ã£o da API secundÃ¡ria (ex: Weather.gov).
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ WeatherService.php                 # ServiÃ§o que orquestra a lÃ³gica de fallback entre os provedores.
â”œâ”€â”€ Http/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Controllers/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ WeatherController.php              # Controlador para responder as requisiÃ§Ãµes de clima.
config/
â””â”€â”€ weather.php                                # ConfiguraÃ§Ãµes especÃ­ficas para as APIs de clima (chaves, endpoints, etc.).
```

### Observations
- The response from the apis are pretty different, so I will need to create a common data structure to handle the data.

### Time Spent
- Planning and Setup: 2 hours
- Backend Development: 4 hours
- Frontend Development: 6 hours
- Testing and Optimization: 2 hours
- Documentation and Delivery: 1 hour
- **Total Time: 15 hours**

### Api Calls examples
- OpenWeatherMap:
	- [data] `api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=-27.097&lon=-48.911&appid={api_key}&units=metric`

- AccuWeather needs two calls to get the weather data:
	- [key] `http://dataservice.accuweather.com/locations/v1/cities/geoposition/search?apikey={api_key}&q=-27.097,-48.911`
	- [data] `http://dataservice.accuweather.com/currentconditions/v1/2733045?apikey={api_key}`
