# Task List - Fullstack Challenge

## 1. Requirements Analysis and Planning
- âœ… Thoroughly review the challenge instructions.
- âœ… Define the overall application architecture (Backend: Laravel; Frontend: VueJS).
- âœ… Identify critical requirements (weather data must be updated every 1 hour and internal API requests must respond within 500ms).

## 2. Setting Up the Development Environment
- âœ… Install Node.js version 18.
- âœ… Configure the Docker environment for the backend (Laravel).
- âœ… Copy the .env.example file to .env.
- âœ… Install PHP dependencies via Composer.
- âœ… Generate the application key using `php artisan key:generate`.
- âœ… Run database migrations with `php artisan migrate`.
- âœ… Execute the seeder to add 20 users with unique locations.

## 3. Building the API with Laravel
- âœ… Initialize the Laravel project.
- âœ… Set up routes and controllers to provide weather data.
- âœ… Ensure internal API requests respond within 500ms. ðŸ‘€ (first cal counts?)

## 4. Integration with the Weather API
- âœ… Choose a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or Weather.gov). ðŸ’¡(Bolth?)
- âœ… Develop the integration with the external weather API.
- âœ… Implement error handling and fallback strategies in case the external API is unavailable.

## 5. Developing the Frontend with VueJS
- âœ… Set up the VueJS environment and install necessary npm dependencies.
- âœ… Build the landing page to list users with their current weather data.
- âœ… Implement functionality to open a modal or new page with detailed weather information when a user is clicked.
- âœ… (Optional) Integrate a UI library (e.g., Vuetify, Tailwind, Bootstrap) to enhance the presentation.

## 6. Testing and Optimization
- âœ… Write automated tests for both the backend and frontend.
- ðŸ‘€ Implement caching using Redis to optimize API responses. (database)
- âœ… Consider using queues and workers for asynchronous operations.
- âœ… Monitor and optimize the application performance to ensure fast responses. ~60ms~

## 7. Documentation and Delivery
- âœ… Document the development process and the technical decisions made.
- [ ] Send the cloned repository link to the interviewer.
- [ ] Report the total time spent completing the challenge.

## Additional Notes

### Weather API Selection
For this challenge, I will choose the OpenWeatherMap API as the primary weather data provider. OpenWeatherMap offers a free tier with a reasonable number of requests per minute, making it suitable for this project. Additionally, it provides a wide range of weather data, including current weather, forecasts, and historical data. As a secondary provider, I will consider using the AccuWeather API, which offers similar features and data quality.

### Application Architecture

```

### Observations
- The response from the apis are pretty different, so I will need to create a common data structure to handle the data.

**Common Data Structure**
```json
{
   "city": "Brusque",
   "country": "BR",
   "latitude": -27.097,
   "longitude": -48.911,
   "observation_time": "2025-02-12T22:14:19+00:00",
   "temperature": 27.9,
   "weather_description": "clear sky",
   "weather_icon": "01n",
   "provider": "primary"
}
```
```json
{
   "city": "Brusque",
   "country": "BR",
   "latitude": -27.091,
   "longitude": -48.931,
   "observation_time": "2025-02-12T18:55:00-03:00",
   "temperature": 31.8,
   "weather_description": "Clouds and sun",
   "weather_icon": 4,
   "provider": "secondary"
}
```

### Api Calls examples
- OpenWeatherMap:
	- [data] `api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=-27.097&lon=-48.911&appid={api_key}&units=metric`

- AccuWeather needs two calls to get the weather data:
	- [key] `http://dataservice.accuweather.com/locations/v1/cities/geoposition/search?apikey={api_key}&q=-27.097,-48.911`
	- [data] `http://dataservice.accuweather.com/currentconditions/v1/2733045?apikey={api_key}`
